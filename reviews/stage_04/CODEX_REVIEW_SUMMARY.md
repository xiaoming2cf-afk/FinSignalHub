# Stage 04 Codex Review Summary

## Current Head Rule

Use PR #11 at https://github.com/xiaoming2cf-afk/FinSignalHub/pull/11. Current-head evidence must come from that PR's head, not from Stage 03 PR #10.

## Findings

Known reviewed heads:

- `306f009e6148ce1645f51216a0cff81e84d48290`: CR-04-001/002.
- `34aa942fd1224f016463c276cf6a4fea2d53049b`: CR-04-003/004.

- CR-04-001 / P2: `reviews/stage_04/STAGE_ACCEPTANCE_RESULT.md` still said logs were updated only through A-0401 / CP-0279 and still treated the PR as pending after PR #11 and later checkpoints existed. Remediation: refresh the acceptance artifact to reference PR #11 and the active blocker state until the remediation head passes CI/Codex.
- CR-04-002 / P2: `reviews/stage_04/` and `deployments/stage_04/` lacked purpose READMEs, violating the repo documentation rule. Remediation: add `reviews/stage_04/README.md` and `deployments/stage_04/README.md` with planning-only purpose and boundaries.
- CR-04-003 / P2: the acceptance result became self-stale again by copying exact artifact/checkpoint values while the same remediation added newer artifact/checkpoint rows. Remediation: change the log gate evidence to point to `CONTROL/18` and `CONTROL/27` as source-of-truth instead of copying an exact latest row into the acceptance artifact.
- CR-04-004 / P2: the PR body did not expose the current Gate 6 blocker after CR-04-001/002. Remediation: update the PR body gate status to disclose that CI passed on prior reviewed heads but current remediation still needs CI/Codex, and that Codex is blocked by CR-04-001 through CR-04-004 until re-review.

## Required Action

After this remediation is pushed, request current-head review again:

```text
@codex review for product alignment, missing tests, security regressions, architecture risks, missing provenance, missing docs, and phase acceptance problems
```

Critical findings must be fixed or explicitly deferred with a reason approved by the phase gate.
