# 13 Release Checklist

## Purpose

Defines required checks before a stage release, tag, or acceptance note.

## Owner

Release coordinator.

## When to update

Update when release evidence, tag policy, PR flow, or stage acceptance changes.

## Required fields

- Stage id
- Local checks
- Documentation checks
- Security checks
- GitHub checks
- GPT Pro checks
- Release note or tag

## Example format

`Stage 00 | local checks pass | GitHub pass | GPT Pro pass | release note created`

## Current state

Stage 00 has passed local governance checks, GitHub PR/CI/Codex review, and GPT Pro final confirmation. Stage 00 release evidence is recorded in `deployments/stage_00/RELEASE_NOTE.md`.

Current tag state: `stage-00-control-system` exists. Stage 00.1 has GPT Pro PASS and phase-gate PASS evidence saved. Stage 00.1 PR #6 was merged into `main` at `75f215bc8647dac9c5e4e55b68b3b84100f064b4`; its release note exists at `deployments/stage_00_1/RELEASE_NOTE.md`.

Stage 01 is not released. Local scaffold implementation checks passed, but PR #7 implementation head has not yet been pushed. Stage 01 release remains blocked until:

- implementation commit is pushed to PR #7;
- current-head CI passes;
- current-head Codex review reports no major issues;
- GPT Pro final implementation review returns PASS or accepted CONDITIONAL PASS;
- GPT Pro next-stage instruction is saved;
- release note or tag evidence is created.
