# Stage 05 GitHub PR

## Branch

## PR

https://github.com/xiaoming2cf-afk/FinSignalHub/pull/12

## Current Head

Use `gh pr view 12 --json headRefOid,statusCheckRollup,reviews` for the live PR head. Most recent checked head before this acceptance-source refresh was `e716ff14992aafb39136d840ed6037a4b05b4a42`; CI passed for that head, and Codex opened CR-05-006/007 on stale next-stage source and PR-body evidence. Any later acceptance-source refresh head must pass CI/Codex again.

## Required Title

`Stage 05: Claim Graph and Research Delta Planning`

## PR Body Source

`reviews/stage_05/PR_BODY.md`

## Required Codex Comment

```text
@codex review for product alignment, missing tests, security regressions, architecture risks, missing provenance, missing docs, and phase acceptance problems
```

## CI Status

Most recent checked head `e716ff14992aafb39136d840ed6037a4b05b4a42` passed both Stage Governance CI jobs. The next acceptance-source refresh head must pass CI again before GPT Pro plan review.
