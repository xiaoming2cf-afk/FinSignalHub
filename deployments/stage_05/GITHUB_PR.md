## Current Head

Use `gh pr view 12 --json headRefOid,statusCheckRollup,reviews` for the live PR head. Most recent checked head before this packet refresh was `32f306c9db6553cc89076dab8a52299946eb12d6`; CI passed for that head, and Codex opened CR-05-003 on stale GPT Pro packet wording. Any later packet-refresh head must pass CI/Codex again.

## Required Title

## PR Body Source

`reviews/stage_05/PR_BODY.md`

## Required Codex Comment

## CI Status

Most recent checked head `32f306c9db6553cc89076dab8a52299946eb12d6` passed both Stage Governance CI jobs. The next packet-refresh head must pass CI again before GPT Pro plan review.
